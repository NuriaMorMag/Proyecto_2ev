            <h2>The Circus at Night</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2025</p>
            <p>There's never anything interesting in my neighborhood, which is why I never
                go out there. But on the one night I went for a walk there, there was a circus
                in a place where there's usually a vacant lot. My friend and I saw that
                the fence was open and went in to investigate.</p>

            <h2>The Vintage Shop in Norway</h2>
            <p class="date">July 9, 2025</p>
            <p>My brother and I visited a vintage store in Norway. When we walked in,
                the hippie shop assistants told us to take our time. We passed through
                an entrance hall and a kitchen, and to reach the actual shop we had
                to go down a narrow staircase. The store was set up like a basement,
                and it felt a bit creepy. At one point, I even lost sight of my brother,
                which really scared me because he wasn't answering and I couldn't hear anything.</p>

            <h2>Art in Berlin</h2>
            <p class="date">August 20, 2024</p>
            <p>My friend lived in Berlin for four years and showed me this abandoned place where
                they used to hold rave parties. To get there, we had to walk through a forest
                where we were eaten alive by mosquitoes.</p>
